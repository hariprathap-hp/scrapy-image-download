Basic python code to scrape images using python and scrapy

Hello Guys!

This is the initial code version to scrape images from a website (Here, I scraped espncricinfo, as it is my favourite website)

To make this code working,

1. First create a Scrapy project "scrapy startproject espn-cricinfo-images" 
2. Browsing through the project structure, you could see a lot of python files and a directory "Spider". 

3.For this basic code to work we need to do two things,
	1. Create our own custom spider and name it like "cricinfo_spider.py"
	2. Modify the below files inside the project structure,
			"settings.py"
			"items.py"
